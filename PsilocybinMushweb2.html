            <p> Psilocybin is a hallucinogen that people can ingest through<br> certain types of mushrooms. Psilocybin works by activating<br> serotonin receptors, most often in the prefrontal cortex.<br> This part of the brain affects mood, cognition, and percep-<br>tion. Hallucinogens also work in other regions of the brain<br> that regulate arousal and panic responses.Psilocybin is much<br> more of a promising treatment for a range of health issues.<br> In particular, experts increasingly see the chemical as a poten-<br>tially effective, low-risk tool to help patients break their depen-<br>dencies on other substances and disorders. Given that more<br> than 100,000 people died after overdosing on opioids and other<br> drugs in the U.S. last year, it’s an understatement to say it’s<br> urgent to find new, effective treatments for various disorders.</p>

                <h8> Psilocybe <br> Cubensis</h8>
                <p> Psilocybe Cubensis is probably the image that comes to<br> mind when we think of psychedelic mushrooms. "Cubes"<br> are amongst the most widely distributed species because<br> of their easy-to-cultivate properties, naturally germinating<br> in cattle dung and grown indoors with substances like<br> coffee or brown rice flour. It is known as a versatile species.</p>

                <h8> Psilocybe  Mexicana</h8>
                <p> Psilocybe Mexicana still grows in Mexico during the rainy<br> season, especially in Oaxaca, Michoacán, Puebla, and others.<br> The species prefers to live in moss, meadows, deciduous<br> forests, and soils rich in manure, as well as alongside roads<br> and trails—but never directly on dung. In Mexico today,<br> they’re often called “Pajaritos” meaning “little birds” for pack-<br>ing such a potent experience into a small, fragile mushroom.</p>

                <h8> Psilocybe <br> Caerulescens</h8>
                <p> Derrumbes are still used ceremoniously by the Mazatec<br> people of Oaxaca, Mexico, and continue to grow in the<br> Sierra Madre mountain range. Derrumbes are small, and<br> have a silvery-blue metallic luster that makes them easy<br>to differentiate from other species. Their potency is low to<br> moderate, and the trip can even be a bit shorter, lasting<br> from three to six hours.</p>

                <h8> B+ Cubensis</h8>
                <p> B+ features a large, lengthy, yellow-white fruiting body, and<br> its hallucinogenic effects are known to usher perceptual feel-<br>ings of warmth and ease. B+ has become the ideal beginner<br> strain since its effects are more moderate and toned-down,<br> as the name implies. Another compliment to the B+ strain is<br> its supernatural ability to reduce side effects of nausea,<br> associated with most other strains of mushrooms.</p>

                <h8> Liberty Caps</h8>
                <p> Liberty caps are the smallest of the top few most potent <br>psilocybin mushrooms. They have a conical or bell-shaped<br> cap, hence their name, and they reportedly taste similar to<br> flour. Most Liberty Caps that are consumed are picked in<br> the wild. But be careful when identifying because they can<br> easily be confused with a few similar-looking poisonous<br> species that grow in the same areas.</p>

                <p> Flying saucers—named for their unique UFO-like shape—<br>are known for their intense visuals and profound inner<br>journeys. The surface of the cap is smooth, with a viscous<br> appearance when moist, feeling sticky to the touch, with a <br>separable gelatinous pellicle that can be removed if<br> the cap is broken carefully.</p>

                <p> Sometimes known as “Thai Pink Buffalo”, this strain was<br> named by ethnomycologist John Allen on the lush Thai<br> island of Koh Samui because it was first spotted next to<br> a Pink Buffalo. It remains a popular strain for home cul-<br>tivators because it colonizes quickly and fruits abundantly<br> if conditions are right.</p>

Golden Teachers make their claim to<br> fame by depositing a palpable sense of ancient intelligence<br> through consoling feelings of heart-centered warmth and love.<br> A sense of educational clarity is often reported with their exp-<br>eriences, offering the perfect balance of consciousness expan-<br>sion and euphoric enjoyment.</p>

                <p> Though these mighty mushrooms are under the category of<br> fungi that thrive on the surface of decaying wood, Wavy Caps <br>deserve a spotlight of their own. As its name suggests, these<br> mushrooms boast a large, flared, umbrella-like cap with ripp-<br>led ridges. If you’re concerned with the potential of experien-<br>cing wood-lover’s paralysis, you’d be happy to hear that Wavy<br> Caps eliminate the potential for experiencing any somatic<br> motor complications.</p>

These bare-striped mushrooms nourish their<br> human counterparts with an energetic vigor of wide-reaching<br> awareness and are no stranger to the psychedelic antics of our<br> modern society. These blue-staining fungi offer an average of<br> 2.5% psilocybin, making them upwards of 3 times more potent<br> than psilocybe cubensis.</p>
