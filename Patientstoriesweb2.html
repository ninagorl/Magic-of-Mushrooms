                <p>"This experience gave me a lot of confidence about my self and my body. <br>A bunch of bad thought / behavior patterns were broken. One of these <br>was pretty bad OCD that made me wash my hands a lot. It gave me a lot <br>of hope that things will be fine, this is the one thing that I heard through-<br>out the trip: Everything is alright. The main reason for the trip was my<br> severe depression and it definitely helped me (although it's not gone).<br> Before all I could do was lay in bed. Now I am trying to rebuild my life one<br> step at a time which wasn't possible before."

                <p>"This was 100% one of the most important experiences in my life. Everything has changed since my trip - I perceive things differently. My love for myself has been restored. I now know that I house everything I need to know, it’s just a matter of looking inside and listening. To put it bluntly, I am woke AF and can’t wait to continue to explore the world in this way. Who wouldn’t want that?…"</p>

                <p> “The experience as a whole was spectacular. I felt completely supported.<br> All that you could need during the experience was right there. Wonderful<br> arrangement. It gave me clear headedness, a whole new outlook of look-<br>ing at things. Even though I feel I had some of the answers before the<br> experience, I feel as if there's an enormous drive now to go on the self <br>improvement journey.”
