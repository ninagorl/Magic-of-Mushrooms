                <h2> Types of Mental Conditions</h2>
                <p>In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58<br> million children and adolescents (1).  Anxiety disorders are characterised by<br> excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms<br> are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment<br> in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by ex-<br>cessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (charac-<br>terised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to<br> whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychol-<br>ogical treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may<br> also be considered.</p>

                    <h7> Depression</h7>
                    <p> In 2021, 280 million people were living with depression, including<br> 23 million children and adolescents (1). Depression is different from<br> usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to<br> challenges in everyday life.  During a depressive episode, the person<br> experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss<br> of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every<br> day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present,<br> which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or<br> low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying <br>or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling<br> especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an<br> increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological treatment exists,<br> and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.</p>

                    <h5> Addiction</h5>
                    <p>Addiction refers to the problematic use of a substance. The harms<br> of substance use can range from mild (e.g., feeling hungover, being<br> late for work) to severe (e.g., homelessness, disease). Treatment <br>options for addiction include self-help, counselling, medications and<br> withdrawal management. More than 50 per cent of people with sub-<br>stance use disorders have also had mental health problems at some<br> point during their lifetimes. When people have mental health pro-<br>blems, even limited substance use can worsen the problem.</p>
