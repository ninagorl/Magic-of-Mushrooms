        <h1> Opioid Epidemic</h1>
        <p>  We are living in a time where there is the biggest opioid epidemic, and it is one<br> of the leading causes of death. Within this tragedy, researchers are experiment-<br>ing with natural and new ways of helping cure various mental disorders. For the<br> first time, researchers find that psilocybin works differently from conventional<br> antidepressants – making the brain more flexible and fluid, and less entrenched<br> in the negative thinking patterns associated with depression.<br> 
        <br>
            Studies suggest that these drugs have enormous promise for depression, and<br> the media has bolstered excitement with stories about people who seem to have<br> been cured of this often debilitating condition. But some researchers see more <br>hype than hope, arguing that the studies have been marred by bias and flawed <br>methodologies. They worry that risks are being overlooked and that people are,<br> once again, being offered the false promise of a quick fix. “We’re playing on<br> people’s vulnerability,” says Joanna Moncrieff, a psychiatrist and researcher at<br> University College London and a critic of psychiatric drugs. “If you’re unhappy<br> and things are going wrong in your life, you want to think there’s a magic pill,”<br> she says. “We all do.” You can almost think of it like a record that might be<br> skipped, you get stuck in these rigid patterns that are inflexible and unhealthy.<br> You’re constantly negatively thinking about the world and yourself. Psychedelics<br> help smooth the ruts so that new patterns can form.</p>

        <h2> Controlled<br> Psychotherapy</h2>
        <p> Over the last 20 years, there has been a growing of research with classic psychedelics<br> — the pharmacological class of compounds that include psilocybin, an ingredient found in so-called magic mushrooms. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, psilocybin can produce perceptual changes, altering a person’s awareness of their surroundings and of their thoughts and feelings. Treatment with psilocybin has shown promise in research settings for treating a range of mental health disorders and addictions.“Our findings add to evidence that, under carefully controlled conditions, this is a promising therapeutic approach that can lead to significant and durable improvements in depression,” says Natalie Gukasyan, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>
